# Introduction

Evil Crow Keylogger is a physical keylogger with the following hardware:

* Atmega32U4 with Arduino Lilypad USB bootloader
* ESP32-PICO module for communication via Wi-Fi
* Slot MicroSD
* USB Host MAX3421
* Hall sensor for unbrick device

**NOTE:** 

* Some keys or modifiers have not been implemented. I don't have time or material to test all the keyboards. If you have any errors, you can contact me by Twitter: @JoelSernaMoreno
* All Keyloggers have been flashed firmware `EvilCrow-Keylogger` before shipping

**Layouts:**

* BE_BE layout support.
* CZ_CZ layout support.
* DA_DK layout support.
* DE_DE layout support.
* EN_US layout support.
* ES_ES layout support.
* FI_FI layout support.
* FR_FR layout support.
* IT_IT layout support.
* PT_PT layout support.
* TR_TR layout support.

**NOTE:** Please do not ask me to implement new functions in this code. You can develop code for Evil Crow Keylogger and send me PR with your new code.

# Installation

## Software requirements

* 0.- Add your user to the dialout group: sudo usermod -a -G dialout USER

* 1.- Install esptool: sudo apt install esptool

* 2.- Install pyserial: sudo pip install pyserial

Now you can flash Atmega32u4 and ESP32-PICO in different ways:

* Automatic installation
* Automatic installation with ESP Flasher
* Manual installation

## Layout support

Evil Crow Keylogger supports several layouts, the en_us layout is by default.

Set up a new layout:

* 0.- Open Keyboard/src/Keyboard.cpp with a text editor

* 1.- Change #define kbd_en_us to another layout. Example: #define kbd_es_es

You can use:
- kbd_be_be
- kbd_cz_cz
- kbd_da_dk
- kbd_de_de
- kbd_en_us
- kbd_es_es
- kbd_fi_fi
- kbd_fr_fr
- kbd_it_it
- kbd_pt_pt
- kbd_tr_tr

* 2.- Save and close Keyboard.cpp

## Automatic installation

1. Install Platformio Core: https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/index.html
1. Download [keylogger-pio](https://github.com/volca/keylogger-pio.git) repository (This is a migration of Evil Crow Keylogger to platformio): `git clone https://github.com/volca/keylogger-pio.git`
1. Download source [EvilCrow-Keylogger](https://github.com/joelsernamoreno/EvilCrow-Keylogger.git). Put the directory in same level with keylogger-pio: `git clone https://github.com/joelsernamoreno/EvilCrow-Keylogger.git`
1. Add jumper GPIO0 to GND for ESP32-PICO
![Jumper](https://github.com/joelsernamoreno/EvilCrow-Keylogger/blob/master/images/jumper.jpg)
1. Connect Evil Crow Keylogger via USB port
1. Go to the keylogger-pio directory: `cd keylogger-pio`
1. Run `flash.bat` or `./flash.sh` to program 32u4 and esp32-pico

**Note:** Please re-plug Evil Crow Keylogger if you run the steps again. Because the script can't reset ESP32-PICO to program mode.

## Automatic installation with ESP Flasher

Buy ESP Flasher: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32556128986.html

1. Install Platformio Core: https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/index.html
2. Download Keylogger-pio: https://github.com/volca/keylogger-pio/tree/prod (This is a migration of Evil Crow Keylogger to platformio): `git clone -b prod https://github.com/volca/keylogger-pio.git keylogger-pio`
3. Download source EvilCrow-Keylogger. Extract the source code and name it as EvilCrow-Keylogger. Put the directory in same level with keylogger-pio
4. Wire ESP Flasher and Evil Crow Keylogger

![Keylogger ESP Flasher](https://github.com/joelsernamoreno/EvilCrow-Keylogger/blob/master/images/keylogger-wired.jpg)

5. Connect Evil Crow Keylogger and ESP Flasher to your laptop
6. Open command line and change directory to keylogger-pio 
7. Run flash.bat or ./flash.sh to program 32u4 and esp32-pico

## Manual installation

* 0.- Download and Install the Arduino IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software

* 1.- Open Arduino IDE.

* 2.- Go to File - Preferences. Locate the field "Additional Board Manager URLs:" Add "https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json" without quotes. Click "Ok"

* 3.- Select Tools - Board - Boards Manager. Search for "esp32". Install "esp32 by Espressif system version 1.0.3". Click "Close".

* 4.- Download/extract EvilCrow-Keylogger repository.

* 5.- Copy the Keyboard and USB Host Shield libraries included in this repository to your Arduino library directory. 

**NOTE:** The Keyboard library included in this repository has been modified, EvilCrow Keylogger needs this library to work.

### Upload the ESP32 code

To upload the ESP32 code into the keylogger, you can do this in different ways: You can use an Arduino, an FTDI or an ESP Flasher from April Brother.
On this way I will use an Arduino to upload the ESP32 code.

Here you can see all the pins corresponding to ESP32:

![ESP32](https://github.com/joelsernamoreno/EvilCrow-Keylogger/blob/master/images/esp32.PNG)

1. Wire the Keylogger with Arduino using the following pinout:
![Flash](https://github.com/joelsernamoreno/EvilCrow-Keylogger/blob/master/images/esp32-flash.PNG)
![Wire](https://github.com/joelsernamoreno/EvilCrow-Keylogger/blob/master/images/wire.jpg)
1. Open Arduino IDE.
1. Open the ESP32.ino sketch.
1. Select Tools
   * Board - "ESP32 Dev Module".
   * Flash Size - "4MB (32Mb)".
   * CPU Frequency - "80MHz".
1. Connecting the Arduino device to the computer.
1. Upload the code to the board.

### Upload atmega32u4 code

* 0.- Connect Evil Crow Keylogger via USB port.

![usb](https://github.com/joelsernamoreno/EvilCrow-Keylogger/blob/master/images/usb.jpg)

* 1.- Open Arduino IDE.

* 2.- Open the ATMEGA32U4.ino sketch.

* 3.- Select Tools - Board – "Arduino Lilypad USB".

* 4.- Upload the code to the board.

* Done!

# First steps with Evil Crow Keylogger

* 0.- Connect a keyboard to the Evil Crow Keylogger USB host port.

* 1.- Connect Evil Crow Keylogger to your laptop.

* 2.- Open a notepad and type Hello World with the keyboard connected to the keylogger

* 3.- Visualize the wifi networks around you and connect to the Keylogger (default SSID: Keylogger).

* 4.- Enter the password for the wifi network (default password: 123456789).

* 5.- Open a browser and access the web panel (default IP: 192.168.4.1).

* 6.- Click on the View Log option

![Log](https://github.com/joelsernamoreno/EvilCrow-Keylogger/blob/master/images/log.jpg)

# Use the Micro SD Slot

Evil Crow Keylogger also stores the log on the Micro SD card.

**File:** log.txt

# Keystroke Injection

Keystroke injection attacks can me executed by navigating to the Live Payload tab. There you can write and run keystroke injection payloads written in simple script.

The parameters allowed to create payloads are the following:

* **print:** Example print Hello World

* **println:** Example println Hello World

* **press:** Example press 131 (This is the GUI key)

* **release:** Example release

* **rawpress:** Example rawpress 176 (This is the RETURN key)

* **delay:** Example delay 3000

To press more keys and modifiers you can use the following link: https://www.arduino.cc/reference/es/language/functions/usb/keyboard/keyboardmodifiers/

**Payload example:**

# Unbrick Evil Crow Keylogger with Hall Sensor

First, you’ll need to set the serial port to the bootloader. But that port is only visible when the board is in bootloader mode, so pull the reset line low twice quickly to invoke the bootloader reset feature. You can quickly press the reset button** twice. While the Evil Crow Keylogger is in the bootloader mode, change the ‘Tools > Serial Port’ menu to the bootloader COM port. Quick! You’ve only got eight seconds.

**The reset button is a HALL sensor, that means you need to place a magnet close that side of the PCB, in order to simulate the "button pressure".**

![Sensor](https://github.com/joelsernamoreno/EvilCrow-Keylogger/blob/master/images/sensor.PNG)

* 1.- Open Arduino IDE and open ATMEGA32U4.ino sketch

* 2.- Connect Evil Crow Keylogger via USB port.

* 3.- Press Upload sketch

* 4.- Start the unbrick phase with a magnet by placing it close that side of the PCB where the hall sensor is located (do it two times). Close-away-close-away
